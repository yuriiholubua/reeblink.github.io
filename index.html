*A decentralized operating system for real estate*

An **open-source DAO infrastructure** that connects traditional property registries across jurisdictions with a unified decentralized ledger — enabling users to build a global real estate network on the blockchain.

Windows — for personal computers  
Android — for smartphones  
Ethereum — for smart contracts  
**Reeblink — for real estate**

⛓️ **Decentralized**  
📡 **Global**  
🏗️ **Purpose-built for property**
